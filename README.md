# Who Is My Roommate

Our University admits a large troop of students for undergraduation. And so the hostel booking process becomes difficult (when servers add to the crowd problem). But that’s totally out of our hands. What this tiny tool could do is host the entire student hostel database when the correct data is inputted by the crowd _after hostel booking is over_.

- Know your future roommate
- Quickly reach out to a friend’s room
- Make the hostels database more open
- Request a roommate swap
